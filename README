This repository stores Arch Linux packages maintained by me. There are a couple of reasons why I host my own repository instead of uploading
them to the AUR.

	1) Avoiding redundancy. Some AUR packages are outdated and their maintainer hasn't updated
	   them in years. Unfortunately, these packages aren't orphaned so I can't maintain them either.
	   So whatever software is outdated on the AUR I take it upon myself to update it myself.

	2) Hosting my own obscure packages. I don't like wasting precious storage space, even if
	   it's only equivalant to 1KB of disk space, only for myself. It's selfish and ruins the
	   purpose of the AUR. If there are people who find my software useful, please let me know
	   and I would be happy to upload it there.
